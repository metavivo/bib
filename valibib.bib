	Abstract = {We constructed a corpus of digitized texts containing about 4% of all books ever printed. Analysis of this corpus enables us to investigate cultural trends quantitatively. We survey the vast terrain of `culturomics,' focusing on linguistic and cultural phenomena that were reflected in the English language between 1800 and 2000. We show how this approach can provide insights about fields as diverse as lexicography, the evolution of grammar, collective memory, the adoption of technology, the pursuit of fame, censorship, and historical epidemiology. Culturomics extends the boundaries of rigorous quantitative inquiry to a wide array of new phenomena spanning the social sciences and the humanities.},

	Abstract = {The Web 2.0 technologies are gradually changing our inter- communication habits. Means such as forums, blogs, wikis, social net- works, etc., are a clear sample about the importance of these tools for expressing and sharing contents, ideas, opinions and so on. From the Nat- ural Language Processing perspective, these technologies are a rich mine for tasks such as Sentiment Analysis, Automatic Humour Recognition or Opinion Mining. In this preliminary study we considered the importance of affectiveness information for blogs analysis. We focused on analysing a set of posts retrieved from a corpus of blogs related to humour in or- der to find the most salient items to represent the affectiveness in such sources. The results indicate that, in terms of a simple counting, there are affective features more linked to some moods than others.},

	Abstract = {Deception is utilized by a variety of intelligent systems ranging from insects to human beings. It has been argued that the use of deception is an indicator of theory of mind (Cheney and Seyfarth in Baboon Metaphysics: The Evolution of a Social Mind, 2008) and of social intelligence (Hauser in Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 89:12137--12139, 1992). We use interdependence theory and game theory to explore the phenomena of deception from the perspective of ro- botics, and to develop an algorithm which allows an arti- ficially intelligent system to determine if deception is war- ranted in a social situation. Using techniques introduced in Wagner (Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction (HRI 2009), 2009), we present an algorithm that bases a robot's deceptive action selec- tion on its model of the individual it's attempting to de- ceive. Simulation and robot experiments using these algo- rithms which investigate the nature of deception itself are discussed.},
